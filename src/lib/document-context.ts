In mathematics, curvilinear coordinates are a coordinate system for Euclidean space in which the coordinate lines may be curved. These coordinates may be derived from a set of Cartesian coordinates by using a transformation that is locally invertible (a one-to-one map) at each point.

When the coordinate surfaces intersect at right angles, the curvilinear coordinate system is called an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. The tangent vectors to the coordinate curves are orthogonal at every point. Familiar examples of orthogonal coordinate systems include the Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems.

The key advantage of using an orthogonal system is that the metric tensor has a simple diagonal form. This simplifies many formulas in vector and tensor calculus. For instance, the del operator, gradient, divergence, and curl can be expressed more simply.
